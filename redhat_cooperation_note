-v0.1 2017.7.5 WangZhou init


Abstract:

 HiSilicon Turing department implements Hi161x/Hi162x ARM Server SoC, we want
 them to be supported by Redhat distributions. So WangZhou(HiSilicon) and MaJun
 (CSI) are assigned the job of Redhat partner engineer to support this. This
 document just help to record the process of Redhat distribution support. As this
 is the first time that HuaWei and Redhat cooperate to enable Redhat distribution
 in HiSilicon ARM SoC, the experience which we get from the process will make
 later cooperation earlier, and we will also record this. For the people who will
 later be Redhat partner engineer, this document will be very usefull.
